# NuPIC Developer Tools

I keep scripts I use for NuPIC development here. More details at some point.

## Assumptions

- You have `git` installed.
- You have the `NUPIC` environment variable set to the path of your NuPIC checkout.
- You are a NuPIC committer (you have push access).

## Installation

Add the `bin` folder to your `PATH`.
